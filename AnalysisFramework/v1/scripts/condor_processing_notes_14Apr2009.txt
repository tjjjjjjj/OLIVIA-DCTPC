condor processing location:
code is set up to submit condor jobs from cockroach.lns.mit.edu
at /net/cockroach/data02/jocelyn/data_processing_14April2009

directories beneath this / notes:
projects/DarkMatter/MaxCam
     contains source code, nb had to modify makefile w.r.t. CVS to 
     point to correct location of fitsio.h on cockroach (/usr/include 
     instead of /usr/local/include as on mitbbr00.lns.mit.edu)
     nb2: MaxCam_linux.so has to be successfully compiled to run the
     AnalysisFramework code.
projects/DarkMatter/AnalysisFramework/v1
     contains data processing code, cleanSkim.C and sortTracks.C,
     and rootlogon.C to set up root environment.
     nb: rootlogon.C has to point to version of MaxCam_linux.so 
     available on /net, and hardcoded paths to MaxCam libraries
     in .C files also need to point to /net location (set up for
     cockroach here, this should be fine for most linux machines)
projects/DarkMatter/AnalysisFramework/v1/scripts
     contains condor submission scripts, more on this below, start
     condor jobs from here by running ./submit_condor_jobs.sh run1 run2
     where run1 and run2 are the first and last run numbers to process
skim
     contains skimmed output files, after condor job completes
sort
     contains sorted output files after condor job completes
condor_err
     contains sterr output of each condor job (title = runnumber.log)
condor_out
     contains stout output of each condor job (title = runnumber.out)
condor_log
     contains condor log info (e.g. condor job #, run machine IP)
     (title = runnumber.log)


to run:
1) cd /nt/cockroach/data02/jocelyn/data_processing_14April2009/projects/DarkMatter/AnalysisFramework/v1/scripts
2) ./submit_condor_jobs.sh run1 run2 
     -run1 and run2 are the first and last run numbers to process
     -this script calls make_condor_job.py, which sets up the enviroment
     and writes the condor job submission file to job_files/condor_spec_runnumber
     -this script submits the job submission file to condor (condor_submit)
     with optional user arguments (e.g. Machine != "qweak.lns.mit.edu")
     nb. all johs doe on qweak for lack of libCint5.14.so
3) to check on them: condor_q where jmonroe
4) to check on the cluster: condor_status
5) output files get moved to the skim/ and sort/ directories when jobs finish
