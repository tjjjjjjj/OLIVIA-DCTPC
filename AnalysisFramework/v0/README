**********************************

The basic principle of this analysis framework is that each task of
analysis should be a module that can be swapped out and exchanged with
another module to test the efficacy of each module. To that end, in this
directory the user will find a number of ROOT scripts (".C" files). Each
of these scripts accomplishes one task, e.g. cleaning the images or
performing a fast reconstruction. Each script is given a "key", a single
string that is uniquely linked to that task. This allows the scripts
(with the exception of a data selection script) to share a common
structure.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
This framework depends on the DMTPC MaxCam software. There is a
rootlogon.C file in the directory, please insert the correct path to
MaxCam.so for your system. This software should be compatible with ROOT
5.14+. 


INPUTS: 
Each module script takes three inputs: a list of the raw data root files
to analyse, a list of keys, and a directory name. The directory name
should be the directory into which the current script stores its
output. The directories must exist before running the script.

OUTPUTS:
Each module creates a root tree with the name of the tree being the key
of that module. It outputs this tree into a file whose name is the same
as the input raw data file, with ".root" being replaced by
"[key].root". Additionally, the module should add to the end of the key
file the output directory and the key.

LOOPS:
Each module has two loops; first over the files passed to it, and then
over each event in the tree in the file. The output is stored file by
file, so that each input ROOT file has one output ROOT file associated
with it. Note that IN NO CASE should events be deleted from the tree. If
no analyzed data is to be saved for that event, the user should simply
store a 0 or a null pointer.

KEY FILE FORMAT: 
The key file should be in the following format. On the first line should
be the directory that contains the raw data files. On each subsequent
line, there should be two entries separated by a tab. The first is a
directory, the second a key. The directory should be the directory where
the script associated with that key outputs. 

ROOT FILE LIST FORMAT:
The files should be listed one to a line, with no associated directory
info. (see KEY FILE FORMAT)

RUNNING:
Each module can be run individually in root by typing, for example,
'.L cleanData.C+' and then 'cleanData()'. There are three scripts that
will run cleanData and quickRecon together: runbasic, runbasiclist, and
runbasicbound. runbasic takes one argument, the five digit run number of
a run. runbasiclist takes several five digit run numbers. The total
number of runs does not need to be specified. runbasicbound takes two
arguments and loops over all the runs indicated by those bounds,
inclusive. These three scripts will delete the root file put out by
cleanData for space reasons.

CLEANDATA:
Input variables: file with run list, file with keys, output directory

This module takes the raw images, creates a background image out of
empty images from the run, subtracts the background and kills any hot
pixels. It also checks for sparks. It also puts out a file ending in
bias.root which contains the background image.

QUICKRECON:
Input variables: file with run list, file with keys, output directory

This module takes the clean images and does pattern recognition to find
events. If there is an event, it calculates some reconstruction
variables. It creates a skim root file that contains all events with
something in them and 1/100 empty events.
