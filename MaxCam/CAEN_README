// CAEN Digitizer Basic Programs 
//
// Pietro Giampa, RHUL, Sept 2012
//

Here is a quick readme file that will guide you through the series of steps need/made 
to operate the CAEN Digitizer via MaxCam.
The first thing is to install the correct libraries, then test the board(s) with the
test executable that allows you to make a connection with the board and then also allows 
you to get a basic readout. 
(For a less detailed list read : CAEN_TODO)

?????
(Not sure whether is best to keep the current scope structure for DMTPC 
or simply write one program and used the CAEN lib in junction to 
controll the digitizer in a new way for the DAQ process)

//----------------//
// CAEN Libraries //
//----------------//

In order to build our own library to controll the CAEN Digitizers via DMTPC software 
we need to install a series of libraries built by the CAEN. The series of libraries that 
need to be installed are the following :

1) CAENDigitizer (most recent version : CAENDigitizer2_2.1)
 
2) CAENComm (most recent version : CAENComm-1.02)

3) CAENVMELib (most recent version : CAENVMELib-2.30.2)

Make sure to include the path where you have installed these libraries in both the Makifile 
for MaxCam and your bash script
(and example of a bash script can be found in my area : 
pietrog/new_cvs/projects/DarkMatter/CAENDigitizer/CAENBash.sh
This example is based on the libraries I've installed at Holloway)
(To set up the libraries in the Makefile, you can use as example
the way the CAEN libraries have been inserted in the RHUL loop)


IMPORTANT : 

The necessary libraries can also be found in Zwicky under the CAEN directory, more specifically 
in the subdirectory V1720/files, follow the README file to install the libraries
The outline is install CAENVMELib first, CAENComm second and last CAENDigitizer. Just untar 
and run the install executable of each lib

//---------------------//
// CAENTEST Executable //
//---------------------//

To quickly test the CAEN digitizer you have in your lab, you can simply run the executable
"caentest", this executable pick basic functions straight from the program 
ScopeCAENv1720.cc (in MaxCam) which is where all the functions that controll the digitizer, set variables
and env and readout data are.
The executable itself make a connection with the board(s) and it also make a basic 
readout that can be controlled via keyboard.
In case someone would like to modify the functions called in "caentest", the file to check 
is in MaxCam and is called runCAEN.c
The "caentest" executable at the moment is set up so that it works with the hardware 
here at Royal Holloway, if someone would have to controll another CAEN digitizer you
would have to make a similar executable with but making sure that in the Makefile
you point to the machine that your Digitizer is connected to. But you can still you the executable
built for RHUL as a basic example.
