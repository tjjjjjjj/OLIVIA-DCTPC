====================================================
This logbook is used to document the progress in 
the Fast Simulation project to be used to 
optimize the 1 m3 detector design 
=======================================================

Goal: "one-click" (one shell script command) from simulation 
      of physics event to production of sensitivity plot, 
      including reconstruction. 

=======================
Sub-Projects
========================

1) Cosmic DM gun 
   =============
   Given the detector geometry, generate nuclear recoils inside that volume 
   uniformly in x, y and z, and taking into account the effects of 
   daily asymmetry and Maxwell-Bolzman distribution

2) Diffusion
   =========
   In reconstruction, parametrize as a function of z the lateral dispersion 
   of the recoil image seen by the camera

   Hint: use measurement published in 
   Observation of the 'head-tail' effect in nuclear recoils of low-energy neutrons, D. Dujmic et al. Aug 2007, Published in Nucl.Instrum.Meth.A584:327-333,2008.
   and work with Timur: he is doing something similar for his package.

3) Intruduce CCD camera in reconstruction. 
   =======================================
   Depending on where the recoil is imaged on the mesh, it will be in 
   one or another camera's filed of view. Start with one camera and 
   then grow from there to a tyling concept. 
   For each camera, introduce the fact that light efficiency depends on R 
   See for example Hermann's presentation in 
       http://dmtpc.mit.edu/MaKaC/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=38
   page 7 or 9 (relative illumination)
   Later on we will have to introduce some distorsions too

4) Background simulation 
   ======================   
   The limits we will be able to place on physics depend very much on 
   the level of background in the chamber. 
   The following backgrounds will have to be implemented: 

   a) alpha particles 
   b) electrons 

   For each background we will have to specify: 
   - where the particle was generated (usually randomly on the surface of some detector component)
   - probability of being generated (some normalization wrt DM recoils)
