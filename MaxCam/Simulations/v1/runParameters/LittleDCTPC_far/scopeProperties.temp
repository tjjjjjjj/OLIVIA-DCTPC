#Most of these are applied in v1/code/SimMesh.cc.

#DecayTime: exponential decay constant of waveform.
#RiseTime: linear rise time of waveform.
#DriftVel: drift velocity of TPC.
#Scale: vertical scaling of waveform. Does not affect voltage resolution or noise.
#TimeNoise1: smears the signal along the time axis.
#TimeNoise2: smears the signal, proportional to sqrt(distance from mesh).
#ZeroOffset: centers the waveform on the x-axis.
#ZeroOffsetVar: Strength of correction to ZeroOffset. (automatically corrected based on values of TimeNoise2 and distance from mesh.)
#NSamples: Precision of signal smearing. 1 is probably fine for 0.0005mm step size; more may be necessary for a large step size.
#VerticalOffset: re-centers the waveform along the y-axis.
#DecayOffset: Not used in current code. Was used earlier in an attempt to model ringing.
