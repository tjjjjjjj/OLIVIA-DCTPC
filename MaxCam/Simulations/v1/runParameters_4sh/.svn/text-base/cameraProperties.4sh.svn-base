# choose something nonzero? It's possible that cleanSkim will get confused 
# by 0 bias.  Shouldn't effect anything, physically speaking, it's just a 
# flat number; Jeremy says that the problem with setting the bias to zero, 
# is that then things don't really work, because of the way sparks 	
# are identified in cleanSkim... [ADU]
#
# post new data format upgrade, the bias HAS TO BE NONZERO to keep pixel
# numbers from going negative, which somehow puts that at VERY large values
# causing all images to be identified as sparks by cleanSkim.  Using 
# 1000 as a hack for now.
Bias			0	1000.
# [ADU/keV]; this comes from the alpha calibration of the cameras
Gain			0	6.0
# Deprecated; the EMCCD had a larger noise than the U6, but that's just 
# directly done in the code now

# [ADU/bin/image] Jeremys says that this should not matter very much, 
# because it's a very small effect.
DarkCurrent		0	0
