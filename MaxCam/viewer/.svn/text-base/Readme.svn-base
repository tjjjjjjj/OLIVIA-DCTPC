DmtpcSkimViewer
---------------------------
Event viewer for DMTPC.

--------------------------

INFORMATION: 

* To compile, use make. Make sure MaxCam is latest CVS version otherwise some stuff will fail and make sure you make shared in MaxCam. 

* Invoke DmtpcSkimViewer with a skim file as an argument to open it immediately. 
  A second argument will set the original data file name (use this if it won't be found automatically).

* Because FFTW is now set up on all the white machines yet, FFT support is
  determined at compile time. If you compile on a machine with FFTW support 
  (i.e. noether) and then run on a machine without FFTW support,
  you will get a warning and it will not work. 

* Appears to be very laggy over network. Blame X11? 


* Keyboard shortcuts:

    next event: d
    previous event: a
    next camera: w
    previous camera: s
    next track: e
    previous track: q
    save: ctrl-s 
    toggle MC: m 
    toggle arrow: v 
    toggle centroid: c 



TODO:
  Input validity checking 
  Determine FFTW support at runtime 
  Split canvas for cameras
  Enter should do go or update probably
  Add status bar 
  Scope transforms 

BUGS:
  Zoomed image doesn't update information about new tracks until the mouse moves. 

  Many more probably...
