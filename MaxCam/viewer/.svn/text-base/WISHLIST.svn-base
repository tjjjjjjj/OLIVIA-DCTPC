* Add button/keyboard shortcut (spacebar?) to append the current event to a playlist file 
  (as a way to log interesting events while scanning).
  (similar to how you log data points in xyscan)
* view all waveforms from a *single* trigger group.
* for overlays, specify a directory that contains an overlay file for each camera
  overlay filename contains the ccd SN.  then when an image loads, and overlays are active, 
  the correct overlay file from that directory is displayed.  
  In other words, "smart" overlay-to-ccd matching based on serial number
* Specify overlays from the command line when launching the viewer
* Implement overlays in the mosaic image (auto-match by serial number and overlay filename?)
* Display found clusters in mosaic window not just in main window
* A "help" page that lists all available keyboard shortcuts
* Keyboard shortcuts appear not to work with X11 on a mac?
* On "next event", update the waveforms in the "Show All" window
* By default, on "next event" display the trigger with the highest amplitude (not trigger 0) for the selected Channel.
* Option for colz to be fixed (as it is now) or dynamic (set on an image-by-image basis -- either with all cameras tied together or each camera allowed to have its own range)
* show image mosaic in the main frame (with reconstruction info as well)
* Add timestamp to the image info frame

DONE
* preserve size of Mosaic window on next event.
