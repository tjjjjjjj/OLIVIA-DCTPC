Compile library for analysis
----------------------------

1) For analysis, only fits libraries are needed (included in standard 
   Scientific Linux distribution). Otherwise cfitsio 3.006 (the version 
   included in SL4) is in the cvs tree under projects/DarkMatter/cfitsio
   as well as an installation script. 

   To install:

   cvs co projects/DarkMatter/cfitsio
   cd projects/DarkMatter/cfitsio
   ./configure --prefix=/usr
   make
   sudo make install 



2) Compilation on MacOSX assumes analysis only.

3) To compile do 'make' in 'projects/DarkMatter/MaxCam'
