  /** \brief Namespace for different one-dimensional kernels useful for filters and other operations

    Currently, this namespace contains only the convolution kernels used by various FIR filters. It may
    be expanded later to include more. The kernels are returned as std::vector<double> in order to have 
    the best precision possible while still being portable. If a long double type is ever standardized,
    it may be useful to change the values here to that.

  /** The Savitzky-Golay class of filters perform a least squares polynomial fit on the data near each 
      point. For a filter of half-width N and order \f$N_O\f$, we can define such a fit by finding the coefficients D[n]
      such that we can approximate the data in a region around each point M by
     \f[ x[n+M] = \sum\limits_{m=0}^{N_0} n^m D[m]\f]
     If we let \f$ A[n][m] = (n-N)^m\f$ and we take \f$0^0 = 1\f$, this can be written 
     \f[ x[n+M-N] = A[n][m] D[m] \f]

     Solving this by the usual least-squares method, we get
     \f[ D = \left(A^T A\right)^{-1} A^T x \f]
     So, letting \f$B = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T\f$, we get estimates for the values of D[n] at point M,
     \f[ D[n] = B[n][m] x[m +M-N] \f]
     If we interpret these as derivatives of the signal, we get
     \f[ x^{(n)}[M] \approx n! D[n] = n! B[n][m] x[m+M-N] \f]

     So, we see that for the \f$N_D(\le N_O)\f$ derivative the correct Savitzky-Golay kernel to use is
